TO DO list

Todo List should have a menu where user can select the different activities possible e.g
        
        Add item to list
        
        Remove Item From List
        
        Mark Item As complete
        
        See all pending Items
        
        Any more interesting functionality
        
        You need to make it such that user can fill in items, close the program.
        When they open it again, they can still see the items.
        This means you are either storing the items to files or Database.

database.properties file consists of:

database.username=

database.password=

database.host=

database.port=

database.DB=
